/-- Represents a word-puzzle configuration.

Fields:
- `repeats`    – when `true`, a letter may appear more than once in a
                 candidate word.
- `size`       – minimum word length (4–9 inclusive).
- `letters`    – the pool of unique ASCII lowercase letters available
                 to form words.
- `mandatory`  – a letter from `letters` that every valid word must
                 contain. -/

/-- Returns `true` when the character is an ASCII lowercase letter
(`a`–`z`).

Unicode lowercase codepoints such as `'é'` or `'ñ'` are excluded
to match the ASCII-only constraint of word puzzles. -/
private def isAsciiLower (c : Char) : Bool :=
  decide ('a' ≤ c ∧ c ≤ 'z')

/-- Returns `true` when the list contains at least one duplicated
element.

Uses a linear scan; each element is checked for membership in the
remainder of the list, giving O(n²) time.  This is adequate for
the short lists encountered in word-puzzle solving (≤ 9 letters,
short dictionary words). -/
def hasDuplicates {α : Type} [BEq α] : List α → Bool
  | [] => false
  | x :: xs => xs.contains x || hasDuplicates xs

/-- Validates the `size` field of a puzzle.

Returns an empty list on success, or a singleton list containing a
human-readable error message when `size` falls outside [4, 9]. -/

  if size < 4 || size > 9 then
    [s!"Size must be between 4 and 9 (got {size})"]

/-- Validates the `letters` field of a puzzle.

Checks that:
1. The length of `letters` is in [4, 9].
2. Every character is an ASCII lowercase letter (`a`-`z`).
3. No character appears more than once.

Returns a (possibly empty) list of error messages, one per failed
condition. -/

    (hasDuplicates chars,
     "Letters must be unique")
  ]
  conds.filterMap (fun (cond, msg) => if cond then some msg else none)

/-- Validates the `mandatory` field of a puzzle.

Checks that:
1. `mandatory` is an ASCII lowercase letter (`a`–`z`).
2. `mandatory` appears in `letters`.

Returns a (possibly empty) list of error messages, one per failed
condition. -/
def validateMandatory (mandatory : Char) (letters : String) :
    List String :=
  let conds := [
    (!isAsciiLower mandatory,

/-- Constructs a validated `Puzzle`, or returns accumulated errors.

Runs all field validators in sequence and collects every error
message.  Returns `Except.ok puzzle` when there are no errors, or
`Except.error errs` with the full list of messages otherwise. -/

/-- Solves a word puzzle for a single candidate word.

A candidate word is accepted when all of the following hold:
- Its length is at least `puzzle.size` characters.
- Every character appears in `puzzle.letters`.
- It contains `puzzle.mandatory`.
- When `puzzle.repeats` is `false`, no character appears more than
  once.

Returns the accepted word (trimmed) as `some String`, or `none` if the
word is rejected. -/
def solve (puzzle : Puzzle) (word : String) : Option String := do
  let puzzleChars := puzzle.letters.toList -- puzzle as chars
  let cleanWord := word.trimAscii.toString -- trim word
  let wordChars := cleanWord.toList        -- words as chars
  guard (
    wordChars.length >= puzzle.size && -- valid word size (4-9 inclusive)
    cleanWord.contains puzzle.mandatory && -- word has mandatory letter
